"Lesson: Introduction to HTML and Front-end Development\n\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of front-end development, which involves creating the visual and interactive elements of a website that users see and interact with.\n\nHTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most tags come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of a web page is placed between the opening and closing tags.\n\nFor example, the following code creates a heading on a web page:\n\n<h1>This is a heading</h1>\n\nThe <h1> tag is the opening tag, and the </h1> tag is the closing tag. The text \"This is a heading\" is the content of the heading.\n\nHTML also allows you to add images, links, lists, tables, forms, and other elements to a web page. These elements can be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website.\n\nFront-end development involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and user experience of a website. HTML provides the structure and content of the web page, CSS provides the styling and layout, and JavaScript provides the interactivity and functionality.\n\nFront-end developers need to have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as design principles and user experience (UX) best practices. They also need to be familiar with front-end frameworks and libraries, such as Bootstrap and jQuery, which can help streamline the development process and improve the quality of the final product.\n\nIn summary, HTML is the foundation of front-end development, and is used to create the structure and content of a web page. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and user experience of a website, and need to have a good understanding of design principles and UX best practices."
