"Lesson: Introduction to CSS and Front-end Development\n\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format web pages. It is an essential part of front-end development, which involves creating the visual and interactive elements of a website that users see and interact with.\n\nFront-end development involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface of a website. HTML provides the structure and content of the page, while CSS is used to style and format the content. JavaScript is used to add interactivity and functionality to the page.\n\nCSS allows developers to control the layout, typography, colors, and other visual aspects of a website. It works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. CSS styles can be applied directly to HTML elements, or they can be defined in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document.\n\nCSS uses a variety of selectors to target specific HTML elements. For example, the \"class\" selector targets elements with a specific class name, while the \"id\" selector targets elements with a specific ID.\n\nCSS also uses a variety of properties to define styles. For example, the \"color\" property sets the text color, while the \"font-size\" property sets the size of the text.\n\nFront-end development is an important skill for web developers, as it is responsible for creating the user interface that users interact with. By learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developers can create engaging and interactive websites that provide a great user experience.\n\nIn conclusion, CSS is an essential part of front-end development, which involves creating the visual and interactive elements of a website. By learning CSS and front-end development, developers can create engaging and interactive websites that provide a great user experience."
