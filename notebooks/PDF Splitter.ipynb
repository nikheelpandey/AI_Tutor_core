      "About This Fourth Edition\n",
      "This fourth edition of this book has changed in three ways. This edition:\n",
      "• Covers both Python 3.0 and \n",
      "Python 2.6—it emphasizes 3.0, but notes differences\n",
      "in 2.6\n",
      "• Includes a set of new chapters mainly targeted at advanced core-language topics\n",
      "• Reorganizes some existing material and expands it with new examples for clarity\n",
      "As I write this edition in 2009, Python comes in two flavors—version 3.0 is an emerging\n",
      "and incompatible mutation of the language, and 2.6 retains backward compatibility\n",
      "with the vast body of existing Python code. Although Python 3 is viewed as the future\n",
      "of Python, Python 2 is still widely used and will be supported in parallel with Python\n",
      "3 for years to come. While 3.0 is largely the same language, it runs almost no code\n",
      "written for prior releases (the mutation of print from statement to function alone,\n",
      "aesthetically sound as it may be, breaks nearly every Python program ever written).\n",
      "This split presents a bit of a dilemma for both programmers and book authors. While\n",
      "it would be easier for a book to pretend that Python 2 never existed and cover 3 only,\n",
      "this would not address the needs of the large Python user base that exists today. A vast\n",
      "amount of existing code was written for Python 2, and it won’t be going away any time\n",
      "soon. And while newcomers to the language can focus on Python 3, anyone who must\n",
      "use code written in the past needs to keep one foot in the Python 2 world today. Since\n",
      "it may be years before all third-party libraries and extensions are ported to Python 3,\n",
      "this fork might not be entirely temporary.\n",
      "Coverage for Both 3.0 and 2.6\n",
      "To address this dichotomy and to meet the needs of all potential readers, this edition\n",
      "of this book has been updated to cover both Python 3.0 and Python 2.6 (and later\n",
      "releases in the 3.X and 2.X lines). It’s intended for programmers using Python 2, pro-\n",

      "some of the most common questions asked by beginners.\n",
      "Why Do People Use Python?\n",
      "Because there are many programming languages available today, this is the usual first\n",

      "last 12 years, some common themes have emerged. The primary factors cited by Python\n",
      "users seem to be these:\n",
      "Software quality\n",
      "For many, Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality in general\n",
      "sets it apart from other tools in the scripting world. Python code is designed to be\n",
      "readable, and hence reusable and maintainable—much more so than traditional\n",

      "even if you did not write it. In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced\n",
      "software reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
      "Developer productivity\n",
      "Python boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically\n",
      "typed languages such as C, C++, and Java. Python code is typically one-third to\n",

      "to which it may not apply.\n",

      "When the Python package is installed on your machine, it generates a number of com-\n",
      "ponents—minimally, an interpreter and a support library. Depending on how you use\n",
      "it, the Python interpreter may take the form of an executable program, or a set of\n",
      "libraries linked into another program. Depending on which flavor of Python you run,\n",
      "the interpreter itself may be implemented as a C program, a set of Java classes, or\n",
      "something else. Whatever form it takes, the Python code you write must always be run\n",

      "In Python, classes are created with a new statement: the class statement. As you’ll see,\n",

      "Why Use Operator Overloading?\n",
      "As a class \n",
      "designer, you can choose to use operator overloading or not. Your choice\n",
      "simply depends on how much you want your object to look and feel like built-in types.\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, if you omit an operator overloading method and do not inherit\n",
      "it from a superclass, the corresponding operation will not be supported for your in-\n",
      "stances; if it’s attempted, an exception will be thrown (or a standard default will be\n",
      "used).\n",
      "Frankly, many operator overloading methods tend to be used only when implementing\n",
      "objects that are mathematical in nature; a vector or matrix class may overload the\n",
      "addition operator, for example, but an employee class likely would not. For simpler\n",
      "classes, you might not use overloading at all, and would rely instead on explicit method\n",
      "calls to implement your objects’ behavior.\n",
      "On the other hand, you might decide to use operator overloading if you need to pass\n",
      "a user-defined object to a function that was coded to expect the operators available on\n",
      "a built-in type like a list or a dictionary. Implementing the same operator set in your\n",
      "class will ensure that your objects support the same expected object interface and so\n",
      "are compatible with the function. Although we won’t cover every operator overloading\n",
      "method in this book, we’ll see some additional operator overloading techniques in\n",
      "action in Chapter 29.\n",
      "One overloading method we will explore here is the __init__ constructor method,\n",
      "which seems to show up in almost every realistic class. Because it allows classes to fill\n",

      "for almost every kind of class you might code. In fact, even though instance attributes\n",
